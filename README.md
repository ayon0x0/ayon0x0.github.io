This repository hosts my personal blog, available at [ayon0x0.github.io](https://ayon0x0.github.io).

I did not create this Jekyll theme myself; I forked it from [s0md3v's repository](https://github.com/s0md3v/s0md3v.github.io).

Interestingly, even s0md3v did not create this theme. He copied it from [stared's repository](https://github.com/stared/stared.github.io).

So, if you like this simple theme, feel free to fork it.

Thanks!
