I have been working in the field since 2016 and doing bug bounty work since 2018.

I have seen the shift from flexing by defacing websites to posting bounties online.

I am currently doing bug bounties and working with a company as a QA engineer, though my main focus is finding security bugs and then performing QA work.

Thanks for visiting my about page. You can DM me on any of my social platforms and reach out about anything you want. I am interested in various topics, from Cyber Security to philosophy.

Thanks again for visiting this page, and I hope you find interesting content here.
