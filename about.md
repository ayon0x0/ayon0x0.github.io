### Now for a less pretentious introduction
I grew up in a small village in Haryana, India. There's nothing much to mention there except poverty, violence and narrow world-views until I turned 17. I worked hard with computers and made a bit of money to achieve temporary mental peace. Now I am into photography, embroidery, philosophy, fashion, teaching young men how to be better people and everything else people without the constant need to survive do. Oh and I still do computers, with more intensity actually; I will always do computers.\
